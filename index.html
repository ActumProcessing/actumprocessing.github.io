        <h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>
<p>Actum&#39;s API allows developers to manage a variety of tasks, such as creating and updating transactions, managing customer and payment data, and querying settlement information. While it was initially built for merchants requiring a high level of customization, its adaptable architecture also helps facilitate integration with software partners. Actum uses HTTPS for all transactions to ensure the safety of consumer information.</p>

<p>This guide provides an overview for our merchants and partners that are seeking to start using Actum. If you have any questions throughout the process, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us at <a href="support@actumprocessing.com">support@actumprocessing.com</a>.</p>
<h1 id='getting-started'>Getting Started</h1>
<p>To get started using Actum&#39;s API, you&#39;ll want to follow these steps:</p>
<h3 id='register-for-a-test-account'>Register for a Test Account</h3>
<p>First, you will want to navigate to Actum&#39;s <a href="https://www.actumprocessing.com/register-test-account/">Register for a Test Account</a> page. You will need to enter your First Name, Last Name, Email, Company Name, and Phone Number to sign up. Actum&#39;s support team will use this information for verification purposes in order to create your account.</p>

<p>Once your account is created (typically within less than 24 hours on business days), you will receive a welcome email with your new test account credentials.</p>
<h3 id='log-into-your-test-account'>Log into your Test Account</h3>
<p>To begin testing, you will be able to log into a test portal using the username and password provided by Actum&#39;s support team. Actum&#39;s portal is available at the following link: <a href="https://join.actumprocessing.com">https://join.actumprocessing.com</a></p>

<p>It is recommended that you change your password immediately upon login. There is no need to create a separate API key to complete setup, as your username and password will allow you to authenticate to Actum&#39;s test enviroment, securely.</p>
<h3 id='create-a-call'>Create a Call</h3>
<p>To create a new API call, you&#39;ll first want to join the server at <a href="https://join.actumprocessing.com/cgi-bin/dbs/man_trans.cgi">https://join.actumprocessing.com/cgi-bin/dbs/man_trans.cg</a>. The following parameters are required:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>username</code> (your assigned username)</li>
<li><code>password</code>(the password associated with your username, that can be changed)</li>
</ul>

<p>(unsure of the following):
* <code>syspass</code> (a system password assigned your account, that cannot be changed)
* <code>action_code</code> (this uses <code>D</code>)
* <code>order id</code> (order number of a test transaction</p>

<aside class="notice">
All API request methods are `POST` only. In this case, `POST` requests act similarly to `GET` requests, in that the requests function primarily to return information pertaining to a specific resource.
</aside>

<p>The content type you&#39;ll need to use is <code>application/x---www---form---urlencoded **or** multipart/form--data</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Persistent Data:</strong> Order Number, SubID
<strong>Reference Data:</strong> History KeyID, Reference KeyID</p>
<h3 id='definitions'>Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Order:</strong> An order is all transactions of Check Pre-Auth, Check Settlement, Check Return, Check Late Return for an order by a consumer.</p>

<p><strong>Transaction:</strong> This is one particular piece of a transaction as in the Check Pre-Auth, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Transaction Block:</strong> Is the block of transactions from validating the account / requesting the monies to receiving the monies or receiving a return. One order can have several transaction blocks for the initial transactions and the recurred transactions.</p>

<p><strong>To Determine Initial Transactions:</strong><br>
Take all transactions for a date range then parse them out by Check Pre-Auth where the Reference KeyID is blank and Recurring Description is Initial. This number gives you the total number of initial signups during that time period.</p>

<p><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refunds can only be issued after a Check Settlement.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking the Stages of an Order:</strong> Each product sold will have a persistent Order Number throughout the life span of the order, even when it is in a recurring stage. The combination of the Order Number, Reference KeyID and History KeyID will let you track the step-by-step transactions that led to the current status of an order.  </p>

<p><strong>Linking up Transactions for a Particular Order</strong></p>

<p>If you get a Check Return but you don’t know where it occurred in the order or from what transaction block, you can use referencekeyid found with the Check Return entry to start the process of finding which block it came from for this particular order. Take this reference keyid and look for a transaction that contains that referencekeyid as the historykeyid. This should return the Check Pre-Auth for which we received the Check Return. You can use this process for any Check Return, Check Late Return, Check Refund, Check Settlement, ACH NOC, etc… until you find a transaction entry that has a blank referencekeyid. This puts you at the beginning of this particular transaction block.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that each time we recur a transaction the Check Pre-Auth will have a blank referencekeyid indicating that a new transaction block is starting. The easiest way to see the transaction blocks in order would be to grab all transactions for a particular orderid and then sort those by date and referencekeyid, which should put those into order from start to finish. Remember, sometimes you may see a Check Settlement for the recurred billing before the initial trial price settles.</p>

<p>Another approach if you wanted to display each transaction block would be to grab all Check Pre-Auth sorted by date with a blank referencekeyid. Then, go through each of those using the historykeyid and find the next transaction in the list by looking for the next transaction that contains that history keyid as the referencekeyid. Grab the history keyid for that transaction and look for the transaction that contains that as the referencekeyid. You can continue this process until you get no more results indicating that you have hit the end of the transaction block and continue with the next transaction block in the list.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is to import everything because the data can be used to your advantage later. Order Number and SubID will always be persistent, and if you sort the transactions by date, you can get a very clear idea of what went on with the account.  In rare cases, we send two transactions per Order Number in one day, but timestamps should show the definitive order.</p>
<h1 id='batch-import-specifications'>Batch Import Specifications</h1><h3 id='ach-transaction-file-format'>ACH Transaction File Format</h3>
<p>The name of the file will need to begin with “ACH_YOURPARENTID_”. The ParentID will be unique to your account and will be assigned by a merchant support specialist upon integration. The file must be a plain text, ASCII file, and all data items may contain only normal ASCII characters (ASCII 32-126). ASCII control characters (ASCII 0-31), Upper-ASCII characters (ASCII 127-255) or Unicode characters are not allowed. This means foreign language (i.e. non-English) characters are not allowed.
Each transaction must be on its own line after the header record - one line per transaction and one transaction per line - after the header line. The field values must be comma-delimited, and all values must be surrounded by double quotes.
Header Line (Line 1 in the file)</p>

<p>The first line of the file is a header line. This line specifies the fields and the order of the fields in every other line in the file:</p>

<h2 id='introduction-to-transaction-types'>Introduction to Transaction Types</h2>
<p>There are two main categories into which all 8 transaction types fall, based on the movement of money:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Debiting</strong> (pulling money from a Receiver’s account)</li>
<li>  <strong>Crediting</strong> (depositing money into a Receiver’s account)<br></li>
</ul>
<h3 id='debiting-transaction-types'>Debiting Transaction Types</h3>
<ol>
<li> Debits</li>
<li> Same-Day Debits</li>
<li> Reinitiated Debits</li>
</ol>
<h3 id='debiting-and-crediting-transaction-type'>Debiting and Crediting Transaction Type</h3>
<ol>
<li> Pre-Notifications or Pre-Notes</li>
</ol>
<h3 id='crediting-transaction-type'>Crediting Transaction Type:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Credits</li>
<li> Same-Day Credits</li>
<li> Refunds</li>
<li> Micro-Deposits</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, transactions can be submitted to Actum through one of three methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the web through the Virtual Terminal</li>
<li>Uploading transaction files via the shared SFTP</li>
<li>Through a direct API integration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='submission-deadlines'>Submission Deadlines</h2><h3 id='through-the-api'>Through the API</h3>
<p>Most transactions must be submitted to Actum by <strong>4:00 PM</strong> (Central Time) in order to be included in that day’s batch file for processing.  Transactions that are submitted after that time will be processed the following day. Originators that need a later submission deadline (e.g., West Coast and/or online businesses) can sign up for Actum’s Late-Night Processing service, which pushes back the submission deadline from <strong>4:00 PM to 9:00 PM</strong> (Central). Both submission deadlines allow for transactions to take effect (i.e., be reflected in the Receiver’s bank account) the following banking day, usually at 9:00 AM (RDFI’s local time).</p>

<p>It’s important to note that Actum accepts transactions around the clock and will not decline a transaction for being late; it will simply be included in the next day’s batch.</p>

<p>There are two transaction types that have an earlier submission deadline: <strong>Same-Day Debits</strong> and <strong>Same-Day Credits</strong>.  These transactions need to be submitted to Actum by 11:00 AM (Central) in order to take effect by 4:00 PM (Central) later that day.  </p>
<h3 id='through-the-sftp'>Through the SFTP</h3>
<p>Transaction files submitted to us through the SFTP can take longer to process prior to being sent to the ODFI. Therefore, the submission deadlines are 30 minutes prior to the API cutoff times, as shown in the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Regular transactions must be submitted by <strong>3:30</strong> PM (Central)</li>
<li>  Late-Night transactions must be submitted by <strong>8:30</strong> PM (Central)</li>
<li>  Same-Day transactions must be submitted by <strong>10:30AM</strong> (Central)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='debits'>Debits</h2>
<p>ACH Debits are used to pull money from the Receiver’s account.  They are the most common transaction type.
Each Debit transaction must include the following data:</p>

<ol>
<li> Receiver’s Full Name (including the Company Name for B2B transactions)</li>
<li> Receiver’s Bank Account and Routing Numbers</li>
<li> Amount to be Debited</li>
<li> IP Address of the client connecting to your server</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to having all the right data fields completed, transactions must not exceed certain <strong>exposure limits</strong>. These are maximums that are set based on historical and expected transaction activity, and are meant to limit the ACH Network’s exposure to the risk of excessive or fraudulent transactions.</p>

<p>Exposure limits are different for every Originator, and it’s the Originator’s job to stay within those limits.  Transactions that exceed an exposure limit will be declined by Actum automatically, which could cause unnecessary payment delays for the Originator.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  To help your clients avoid such delays, Actum recommends that you help them keep track of their exposure limits, which are available through our Exposure Limits API.  Here, you can set up alerts for when a client is getting dangerously close to an exposure limit, so that he/she can proactively contact Actum to request a limit increase.  </p>

<p>There are five exposure limits:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Maximum dollar amount per transaction</li>
<li>  Maximum dollar amount per day</li>
<li>  Maximum dollar amount per month</li>
<li>  Maximum transaction count per day</li>
<li>  Maximum transaction count per month</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='same-day-debits'>Same-Day Debits</h2>
<p>Similar to regular ACH debits, <strong>Same-Day Debits</strong> have the same requirements, and are subject to the same exposure limits, as regular ACH Debits.  The only difference is the submission deadline (11:00 AM instead of 4:00 PM, Central) and the effective date (today instead of tomorrow morning).  They must also be designated for same-day processing in the API request or file.</p>

<p>The data requirements are spelled out in greater detail in our <a href="Link">Integration Guide</a> and <a href="Link">File Import Specifications</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Because Actum does not decline late transactions, and instead includes them in the next batch file, it may be helpful for your software solution to include an automated post-submission message letting your client know the submission was late and will therefore take effect on the following banking day instead of later that day.</p>
<h2 id='reinitiated-debits'>Reinitiated Debits</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of <strong>Reinitiated Debits</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stopped Payment Retries</strong>, which are used when a Debit transaction failed due to the following ACH Return Code:

<ul>
<li><code>R08</code> for Payment Stopped (the Receiver has placed a stop payment order on this debit Entry)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NSF Retries</strong>, which are used to reinitiate previously failed Debit transactions resulting from one of two qualifying ACH Return Codes:

<ul>
<li><code>R01</code> for Insufficient Funds (the Receiver’s available balance is not sufficient to cover the dollar value of the debit Entry), and</li>
<li><code>R09</code> for Uncollected Funds (the Receiver has a sufficient ledger balance to satisfy the dollar value of the transaction, but the available balance is below the dollar value of the debit entry).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If a Debit transaction fails due to ACH Return Code <code>R08</code>, the Originator must receive separate authorization from the Receiver to reinitiate the Debit.  </p>

<p>For <code>R01</code> and <code>R09</code>, while a separate authorization is not required, it is considered a best practice for the Originator to follow up with their customer (the Receiver) to arrange a future date for the NSF Retry.</p>

<p>An Originator is limited to 2 Reinitiated Debits and must submit them within 180 days of the initial Debit. NACHA requires that these transactions be identified as Reinitiated Debits rather than submitted as new transactions. Any fees that are assessed by the Originator must also be clearly identified or explained at the time of the initial authorization.</p>

<p>Actum recommend using the following, or substantially similar, language:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>“If your payment is returned unpaid, you authorize us to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect a fee of [$ ];”</em> or</li>
<li><em>“If your payment is returned unpaid, you authorize us to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect a fee. The fee will be determined [by/as follows]: [ ].”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Actum recommends that you create an action (allowing your users to reinitiate a previous failed transaction) that turns on automatically, upon the receipt of a qualifying ACH Return Code.  The action should include fields where your users can enter a return fee and a future date for the Reinitiated Debit.  Your system should also disable the action based on the number of attempts (two maximum) and the time that has elapsed (180 days).  Actum&#39;s developer support team will offer guidance on how best to program this action in your software solution.</p>
<h2 id='pre-notes'>Pre-Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Pre-Notes</strong> are zero-dollar transactions that are used to validate the Receiver’s bank account number.  They precede the authorized Debit or Credit transaction by three banking days.</p>

<p>An RDFI that receives a Pre-Note has three days to return it or to provide the ODFI with a <strong>Notification of Change (NOC)</strong>.
NOCs are a type of return that the RDFI sends when they accept a transaction despite there being minor errors in the data.</p>

<p>For example, if the RDFI was able to locate the Receiver’s account based on the submitted information, but the account number was slightly off, they would send an NOC (with the correct account number) to the ODFI. As part of our service, Actum will automatically apply those corrections in the subsequent debit transaction and in our database.</p>

<p>If the Pre-Note does not get returned by the end of Day 3, the account will have been validated, and the accompanying Debit or Credit Entry will go out automatically. Similarly, if the Pre-Note does get returned, then the Entry will not be processed and the Originator should follow up with the Receiver to get the correct information.</p>

<p><em>While using Pre-Notes does delay fund settlement by three additional days, it’s considered a best practice. In fact, starting September of 2019, NACHA will require Originators to validate all newly authorized bank account numbers for web transactions using commercially reasonable methods.  And while there are some cool API-driven online bank account verification services to accomplish this (e.g., Plaid, Yodlee, Quovo, MicroBilt, etc.), Pre-Notes are the only full-coverage option available.</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because a Pre-Note transaction must also include an authorized Debit or Credit, they are not submitted as two separate Entries. Rather, they are submitted as one normal Entry with the authorized amount (subject to the same rules and exposure limits) and a special designation to be Pre-Noted.</p>

<p>The data requirements are spelled out in greater detail in our <a href="Link">Integration Guide</a> and <a href="Link">File Import Specifications</a>.</p>
<h2 id='credits'>Credits</h2>
<p><strong>ACH Credits</strong> are used to deposit money into the Receiver’s account.  </p>

<p>The most important rule to understand here is that Credit transactions must be pre-funded.  Not all Originators will utilize ACH Credits, but the ones that do will understand that they must maintain a Credit Reserve Balance in their Actum account to fund their submitted Credit transactions.</p>

<p>The Credit Reserve Balance must be separately funded by one of several options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wires initiated by the Originator
Reverse wires authorized by the Originator and initiated by Actum</li>
<li>ACH debits initiated by Actum from the Originator’s bank account</li>
<li>Transfers from the Originator’s settled Debits before they are paid out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actum automatically declines any Credit Entries submitted through the API that would cause the Credit Reserve Balance to go negative.  </p>

<p>The same information that’s required for an ACH Debit transaction is also required for an ACH Credit transaction (e.g., Receiver’s name, bank account details, transaction amount, etc.).  Unlike Debits however, Credits do not have the same exposure limits, unless the Originator requests them.  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Actum recommends that you use our <a href="Link">Credit Reserve API</a> to display an up-to-date balance as a reference point for your clients.</p>
<h2 id='same-day-credits'>Same-Day Credits</h2>
<p><strong>Same-Day Credits</strong> are submitted just like normal Credit Entries.  They are subject to the same Credit Reserve Balance requirement as normal Credits.  The only difference is the same-day designation and the earlier submission deadline.</p>

<p>How these transactions get designated as same-day Entries will be further spelled out in our <a href="Link">Integration Guide</a> and <a href="Link">File Import Specifications</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, NACHA limits the transaction size for Same-Day Credits to $25,000 per Entry.  Effective March 20, 2020, NACHA will increase the per-transaction dollar limit to $100,000.</p>
<h2 id='refunds'>Refunds</h2>
<p><strong>Refunds</strong> are a type of Credit transaction back to the Receiver.<br>
So far, all the transaction types we’ve reviewed are submitted through a single API: Actum’s Submit API. Refunds, however, are submitted through a separate Refund API.</p>

<p>Because Refunds can only be issued against a previously settled Debit transaction, the required data are limited to that previous transaction’s unique IDs (generated by Actum) and the amount to be refunded.</p>

<p>Currently, our system does not allow for partial Refunds and the amount to be refunded must equal the amount of the initial Debit transaction.  Partial Refund functionality will be announced in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Actum recommends creating a Refund action that gets enabled for each Debit or Same-Day Debit transaction upon settling.  All previous transactions should be stored and easily searchable so that if your users get a Refund request from the Receiver, they can process it with a click of a button.</p>
<h2 id='micro-deposits'>Micro-Deposits</h2>
<p><strong>Micro-Deposits</strong>, while not as common as they used to be, can be a useful verification tool for certain applications.  </p>

<p>It’s easy enough for someone to steal another person’s bank account information and use that to fraudulently pay the Originator for services.  To protect against that, some Originators will submit a Micro-Deposit transaction, which includes two separate amounts (usually a few pennies), and ask the Receiver to report back those amounts.  If the amounts match up, then the Originator has verified that the bank account is indeed the Receiver’s.</p>
<h1 id='understanding-the-ach-payment-flow'>Understanding the ACH Payment Flow</h1>
<p>Before embedding a software or web-based solution to facilitate Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments, you&#39;ll want to make sure that you understand how the ACH payment flow works.  The rules and processes around ACH will impact the features you build and how you communicate the status of a transaction.</p>

<p>This document will briefly introduce you to the ACH payment flow and how it relates to Actum&#39;s ACH processing procedures and policies.</p>

<h2 id='introduction-2'>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before building out a software or web-based solution to facilitate Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments, it is first important to understand how the ACH payment flow works.  The rules and processes around ACH will impact the features you build and how you communicate the status of a transaction.</p>

<p>The ACH Network is managed by <strong>NACHA</strong> and is made up of banks and credit unions, called depository financial institutions.  Only depository financial institutions can transmit transaction data to the Federal Reserve (or the Electronic Payments Network, another ACH Operator), and they do so in batches throughout the day.  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>NACHA is the governing body that establishes and enforces the processes and rules for ACH transactions.</em></p>
<h2 id='how-ach-works'>How ACH Works</h2>
<p>In the world of ACH Processing, there’s <strong>Originating</strong> and there’s <strong>Receiving</strong>.  </p>

<p>For the purposes of understanding the ACH payment flow, it can be helpful to think of these actions as describing the movement of transaction data (and not the actual money).  Whether a merchant collects or sends funds from a customer, the merchant&#39;s business is the <strong>Originator</strong>, and its customer the Receiver.  </p>

<p><em>The Originator is an individual or entity that has received authorization from the Receiver to initiate a direct payment (ACH debit) or direct deposit (ACH credit) over the ACH Network.</em></p>

<p>Not all originating merchants have ACH originating capability with their depository financial institutions.  In fact, most businesses require an intermediary with an established relationship at an <strong>Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI)</strong> in order to originate transactions. In this case, that intermediary is Actum Processing.</p>

<p>With an intermediary involved, the Originator will submit a transaction to Actum, which will then send that data to its ODFI, and transmit that data to the Federal Reserve or other ACH Operator.  </p>

<p>As an example, let’s say that the customer’s bank account is at Wells Fargo.  In this case, Wells Fargo would be the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI).  If this transaction were an ACH debit for $100, Wells Fargo would see its ledger at the Federal Reserve decrease by $100, automatically, while the ODFI would see an increase by $100 (if this were an ACH credit, Wells Fargo would see its ledger increase, while the ODFI would see a decrease).  This increase or decrease should be further reflected in the individual accounts at the different banks.   </p>
<h2 id='ach-returns'>ACH Returns</h2>
<p>In most cases, an RDFI has two business days to object to a transaction and take back the funds from the ODFI.  This objection comes in the form of an ACH Return Code.<br>
For example, if the customer’s account had insufficient funds or simply didn’t exist, Wells Fargo would send the ACH Return Codes <code>R01</code> or <code>R03</code>, respectively, to Actum’s ODFI and the transaction would be reversed, leading to a failed transaction.  There are many reasons why a transaction might be returned, and sometimes customers have up to 60 days to dispute a charge, which could reverse a transaction that had already settled.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  When there’s a return due to insufficient funds, the business that received the return can follow up with the customer and resubmit the transaction. However,it must not be submitted as a new transaction. Per NACHA rules, the transaction must be submitted as a <code>Retry PYMT</code>, which may include the addition of a retry fee in order for the merchant to recoup the return fee that Actum passes on from its ODFI (such as a bounced check fee).  </p>

<p>Therefore, your software (or web) solution should account for this requirement.</p>

<p>Refer to this list of <a href="Placeholder%20for%20Document">85 ACH Return Codes</a>, so that your software can translate them in a way that allows the user to quickly take action, such as contacting the customer).</p>
<h2 id='batch-processing'>Batch Processing</h2>
<p>As you can see, ACH doesn’t happen in real-time. While Actum helps streamline ACH processing as much as possible, it is not a fully-automated process.</p>

<p>Not only is the process somewhat manual because the RDFI can return a transaction, even after the money technically “changed hands” between banks, but also because ODFIs use a batch processing system.  </p>

<p><strong>Batch processing</strong> occurs when an ODFI waits to aggregate all incoming transaction data into a single batch file before transmitting it to the Federal Reserve at regular intervals throughout the day.  Similarly, ACH Return Codes are also batched before being transmitted from the ODFI to Actum at regular intervals throughout the day.</p>

<p>Actum operates by a batch processing system.  This can be helpful to understand, as there is typically a buffer zone between when the Originator submits their transaction data and when Actum sends it to the ODFI. As a result, the Originator can edit or revoke a recently submitted transaction.  It also means that the status of a transaction can change only at predetermined times throughout the day.</p>
<h2 id='how-actum-transactions-work'>How Actum Transactions Work</h2>
<p>A transaction that you submit to Actum can get accepted or declined. However, being accepted by Actum doesn not mean that the transaction cleared. Rather, it means that Actum&#39;s system automatically approved it for transmission to an Actum ODFI.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a transaction submitted through Actum&#39;s API gets declined, a response code that details the reason for the decline will be generated automatically.</p>

<p>Once a transaction is accepted by Actum, its status will remain <code>pending</code> until one of two things happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>the transaction settles (a predetermined time period, or settlement period, has elapsed), or</li>
<li>the transaction fails (an ACH Return Code is received during the settlement period).</li>
</ol>

<p>All accepted transactions will settle, as long as an ACH Return Code is not received by the end of its settlement period.<br>
If the transaction settles, it will do so at 2:00PM (Central Time) on the last day of its settlement period. The status will change from <code>pending</code> to <code>settled</code> at 2:00PM, as a result.  The Originator can then expect to receive their associated funds on the following business day, depending on how their account is setup.</p>

<p>If an ACH Return Code is received before the end of the settlement period, the transaction will fail. In this case, the failure may not be reflected in its status immediately.  Because of the batch processing system, it can take a few hours between when an RDFI returns a transaction, notifies the ODFI, and when the ODFI notifies Actum, and in turn the Originator.</p>

<p>Actum updates its files twice a day, once at 6:00AM (which would include any returns from the past 24 hours) and again at 4:00PM (which would include any other returns that might have come in until 3:00PM that day). Ultimately, for failed transactions, the status can only change either at 6:00AM or 4:00PM.</p>

<p>These times are important to note, because Originators want to know as soon as the information is available, if a transaction failed, so that they can act on it (e.g., follow up with the customer, suspend delivery of service, etc.).  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  To meet the evolving expectations in the software industry, we are currently developing webhooks to push status changes to you as they happen.  Until then, we can only provide statuses on-demand through an API call.  Traditionally, it has been up to the Originator (or the software partner facilitating payments for the Originator) to develop their own status update protocols on their platform based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their own settlement date calculations, and</li>
<li>Parsing through their clients’ transaction history files (provided through an SFTP on a daily or twice daily basis) to match return line items with their respective transactions using their Reference Key IDs.<br></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='late-returns'>Late Returns</h2>
<p>What happens when an ACH Return Code comes in after the settlement period ends?  </p>

<p>First, Actum will advocate on your behalf to dishonor the return, if applicable.  If the return is legitimate, however, then it will be considered a Late Return and deducted from that day’s settlement calculation.</p>

<p>As an example, if you had 10 transactions of $20 each, scheduled to settle today, and there were no returns by 2:00PM, the full $200 would settle and be paid out to the Originator.  If a legitimate return for one of those transactions is received later that day or tomorrow, and you have another $200 scheduled to settle tomorrow, only $180 would end up settling tomorrow ($200 settlement LESS the $20 late return).</p>
<h2 id='using-actum-to-facilitate-ach-payments'>Using Actum to Facilitate ACH Payments</h2>
<p>There are three main ways to interact with Actum:</p>

<ol>
<li> On the web through our Virtual Terminal</li>
<li> Via SFTP to upload transaction files and download history files</li>
<li> Through a direct API integration</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of Actum&#39;s software partners and web merchants use a combination of the last two methods, by pushing transactions to Actum in real-time through an API call, then pulling transaction history files from us at scheduled intervals (6:00AM and 4:00PM) through a shared SFTP.</p>

<p>Some merchants use payment management software that is not directly integrated with Actum. Those merchants will often use the SFTP method to upload transaction files, or the Virtual Terminal to manually enter transactions and access their reports.</p>
<h2 id='actum-39-s-api'>Actum&#39;s API</h2>
<p>The following actions are available through our APIs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Submit transactions</li>
<li>Validate a customer’s bank account</li>
<li>Refund a transaction</li>
<li>Edit or revoke a recently submitted transaction before it gets sent to the ODFI</li>
<li>Cancel or update a recurring transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several transaction types that your software (or web) solution should accommodate:
*   Debits
*   Credits
*   Same-day Debits
*   Same-day Credits
*   Refunds
* Pre-Notes
* NSF Retries</p>

<p>Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.</p>

<p>We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.</p>

<p>This example API documentation page was created with <a href="https://github.com/lord/slate">Slate</a>. Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API&#39;s documentation.</p>
